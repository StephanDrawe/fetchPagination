# FetchPagination
## Description:
First project utilizing useEffect in React. Data is data fetched, manipulated, and rendered from an external source to create a simple contact list with responsive UI.
This project also utilizes simple bootstrap styles.
## How to Run:
1. Fork the repository in its entirety into your account.
2. clone the repository to your machine.
3. Run the command **cd path/to/project/root**, which allows you to point to the root folder of the starter files (note that path/to/project/root should be replaced with the actual path to the starter files).
4. Within the same command-line window, run **npm install** to install all dependencies.
5. Once the command completes successfully, run **npm start** to start the application in your browser.
6. To end application, hit ^c.
## Roadmap of future improvements:
Currently the pagination navigation is not producing the desire result. Further iterations of this program will fix this issue.
